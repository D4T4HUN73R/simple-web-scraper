# simple-web-scraper
This scraper will send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, parse the HTML content of the page using BeautifulSoup, and then find all the &lt;p> elements on the page. It will then print the text of each paragraph.

You can customize this scraper to fit your needs by changing the URL, the elements you are looking for, and the data you want to extract from the page.

Here are a few additional tips for web scraping:

Make sure to respect the website's terms of service and any relevant laws when scraping.
Use time.sleep() to add delays between requests to avoid overwhelming the website with too many requests at once.
Use error handling to gracefully handle any HTTP errors or other exceptions that may occur.
Consider using a headless browser like Selenium to handle more complex scraping tasks that require JavaScript execution.
